This example project demonstrates:
1. how to run spparks with an input script for dissociative adsorption

To run this example:
1. copy the executable "spk_nonmui" to the current directory:
   --> cd 01_run_diss_ads
   --> cp ~/GIT/FHDeX/exec/compressible_stag_mui/SPPARKS_MUI/spk_nonmui .
2. execuate the shell script:
   --> ./run_single.sh

This project contains the following files:
    README              this file
    run_multiple.sh       shell script
    create_site_file.py creates sites data file "data.strips"
    in.diss_ads         spparks input script
    clean.sh            deletes all data and outcome files
    parse_compute.py    computes the correlation, by reading the spparks trajectory
    graph.py 		graph one sppakrs trajectory
    plot_correlation.py graph correlation computed from parse_compute.py
