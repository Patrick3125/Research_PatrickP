This example project demonstrates:
1. how to run spparks with an input script for dissociative adsorption

To run this example:
1. copy the executable "spk_nonmui" to the current directory:
   --> cd 01_run_SPPARKS
   --> cp ~/GIT/FHDeX/exec/compressible_stag_mui/SPPARKS_MUI/spk_nonmui .
2. execute the shell script:
   --> ./run_multiple.sh
   --> ../02_parse_log/loop_SPPARKS_logs.sh
   --> ../03_stats/loop_res_files.sh
   --> python ../04_plot_data/plot_correlation.py         or        python ../04_plot_data/plot_log.py

This project contains the following files:

	README              	this file

   01_run_SPPARKS/
	run_multiple.sh     	    run simulation multiple times
	run_all.sh  		        run all codes in order from simulation to graph. This will erase all exsisting log files
	create_site_file.py     	creates sites data file "data.strips"
	in.diss_ads              	spparks input script

   02_parse_log/
	loop_SPPARKS_logs.sh	    iterate though all SPPARKS log files and call parse_compute to parse them
	parse_compute.py    	    parse one SPPARKS log file 

   03_surface_coverage/
    compute_av_surface_cov.py   computes average surface coverage and theta, and then saves it to res/theta.txt and res/average_surface_coverage.txt
    plot_one_cov.py             plots one spparks trajectory
    plot_all_cov.py             plots all spparks trajectory along with average coverage and errorbars    

   04_correlation
	loop_res_files.sh		    iterate though all res files created by 02_parse_log, and calls compute_correlation
	compute_correlation.py	    compute correation of one res file
	compute_av_correlation.py	compute averaged correlation and variance
	plot_correlation.py 	    graph correlation computed by 03_stats/
	plot_log.py		            grapg correlation computed by 03_stats/ in a log scale
